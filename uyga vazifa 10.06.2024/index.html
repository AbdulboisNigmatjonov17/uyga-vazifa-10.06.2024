            <p><b>Directions:</b> Mix all ingredients in large saucepan with high sides. Bring to a boil. It will be very thin at first and not have good flavor. Reduce heat to low, and simmer, just bubbling. Check taste about half way through the cooking process when the sauce coats the spoon. Adjust for sweet and sour to desired taste. If too sour add a little brown sugar and dark corn syrup in small amounts. If too sweet, add a little cider vinegar in small amounts. It never hurts to put more Applejack in. Continue to cook at very low bubble until desired consistency, stirring occasionally, about 4 or 5 hours. Make sure it does not stick or become too thick. It will thicken some when cooled and all of the flavors will come together at the end. I like to use the restaurant style coarse black pepper so you can see it in the sauce. To make the sauce hotter, add another teaspoon of black pepper and another 1/8 teaspoon of white and red pepper.</p>
